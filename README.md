# CA1
#CA1 assessment of Data-Science for (heart-attack) dataset
#Analyzing and dealing with the data related to the "HEART" for visualizing different variables related to functioning & working of the patients heart and get them analyzed to their "HEART".

#A heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI) is a serious medical emergency in which the 
supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a blood clot. Coronary heart 
disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks. CHD is a condition in which the major 
blood vessels that supply the heart get clogged with deposits of cholesterol, known as 
plaques. Before a heart attack, 1 of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing a blood clot to 
develop at the site of the rupture. The clot may block the supply of blood to the heart, 
triggering a heart attack.

#The dataset is constructed of the following variables.
#Age : Age of the patient
#Sex : Sex of the patient
#exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
#ca: number of major vessels (0-3)
#cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type
 Value 1: typical angina
 Value 2: atypical angina
 Value 3: non-anginal pain
 Value 4: asymptomatic
#trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
#chol : cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
#fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
#rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results
 Value 0: normal
 Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or 
depression of > 0.05 mV)
 Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
#thalach : maximum heart rate achieved
#target : 
0= less chance of heart attack 
1= more chance of heart attack
